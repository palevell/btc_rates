* Description

I started this project in 2017, to explore blockchain programming in Python, and quit using it in 2019.  Since 2021, it has been running hourly and Emailing me daily reports.

After Trump was re-elected as President in the USA, Bitcoin prices began getting closer to $100,000, and I wanted to add more reporting options.  Upon investigation, I discovered that the ~blockchain~ library is no longer listed in ~blockchain.info~'s GitHub repositories.  Not only that, ~get_price()~ method doesn't include a timestamp of any kind, so I was motivated to find another way to get Bitcoin prices, preferably including price history.  There is an unofficial *Yahoo Finance* library in Python that seems to provide me with what I want.
