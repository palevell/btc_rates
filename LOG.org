** Issues
*** No Data at Midnight
- Evidently, YFinance needs a few minutes to get the previous day's data
- Added ~sleep_until()~ function that waits until five minutes after midnight, when necessary
* Sunday, December 15, 2024
** Issues
*** YFinance Returning Extra Data
**** Details
- *Symbol:* TSLA
- *Date Range:* yesterday and today
- *Markets Open/Closed:* closed (program says markets were open)
- *Results:* data for two days ago
**** Cause
- My ~date_list()~ generator returned an empty list when the date range was a single day
- Default value for markets open flag is "open" (~was_open == True~)
**** Solution
- Add logic to ~date_list()~ to handle a date range of one day

** Issues
*** XDG Runtime Directory
- ~XDG_RUNTIME_DIR~ seems to be unavailable to cron jobs
- It can be specified in ~~/.crontab~
** Deployment
1. Used ~pg_dump -t btc_rates.dt_yahoo_daily --data-only~ to export data
2. Dropped the ~btc_rates~ schema from the database
3. Ran ~sqitch deploy~ to "officially" create the database
4. Restored the data with ~xzcat yt_yahoo_daily.sql.xz | psql~
* Friday, December 13, 2024
** Program Changes
- Retired ~btc_rates~ on local machine (still running on VPS)
- ~btc_rates4~ is the main program, until I completely retire ~btc_rates~
- Upgraded ~btc-rates-daily.sh~ to work with the database
** Jupyter Notebooks
- Much of my research is in the ~notebooks~ directory
** Charts & Graphs
- I have been playing with ~matplotlib~ in Jupyter notebooks
- I haven't decided on what it is that I might want to chart
* Monday, December 9, 2024
** New Polling Program
*** Features
**** Data Provider: Yahoo! Finance
- This is a Python package (~yfinance~) that shares data scraped from Yahoo! Finance (it isn't an actual API)
- The following alternatives to Yahoo! Finance don't seem to offer better results:
  * [[https://alphavantage.co][AlphaVantage]]
  * [[https://apiverse.com][ApiVerse]]
  * [[https://marketstack.com][MarketStack]]
  * [[https://polygon.io][Polygon]]
**** Database: PostgreSQL
- Limiting data collection to daily data
- Have collected entire available price history (since 2014)
* Monday, December 2, 2024
** Remote Database Connections
#+begin_example shell
ssh -f -N -L 6333:localhost:5432 vps
psql postgresql://localhost:6333
#+end_example
*** Copy price table
#+begin_example shell
pg_dump -t btc_rates.dt_price --data-only | psql postgresql://localhost:6333
#+end_example
** XDG Directories
*** New: ~XDG_STATE_HOME~
- Default: ~$HOME/.local/state~
- Purpose: Program state, logs, history, current cursor/reading position, etc.
* Sunday, December 1, 2024
** New Version of Polling Program
- ~btc_rates~ was my initial project with the ~blockchain~ library
- After five years, it is time to modernize
*** New Features
- ~loguru~ for logging
- Integrate with database
* Saturday, November 30, 2024
** Adding a PostgreSQL Database
- PostgreSQL provides a much better way to query the database
** Database Version Control: Sqitch
- This has become my preferred tool (over SQLAlchemy)

* Wednesday, November 27, 2024
- With Bitcoin prices on the rise, I working on this project, again
** Adding Reports
*** Adding SQLite Database
- A SQLite database seems the fastest way to produce summary reports (ie. weekly, monthly, etc.)

* Thursday, December 9, 2021
- Added "retry" loop


* Monday, December 6, 2021
- Blew the dust off of this project...
- Added logging facility
- After fiddling with the sleep timer, I opted to just use fcron
